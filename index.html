    <div class="container instructions">
      <h3 class="instructions-heading">Instructions</h3>
      <div class="container instructions-list">
        <ol>
          <li>Heat up the water.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Carefully select the water that you want to make into coffee. Soft water is preferable to hard water, so
              use a Brita
              or similar filter if you need it. If your tap water has a chlorinated smell, use bottled water instead.
            </li>
            <li>Heat the water up to 208&deg;F. The extra heat extracts more flavor from the coffee. After brewing, let
              this beverage cool down for a few minutes before drinking it.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Grind the beans.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Your coffee should be ground "medium," or maybe a little finer. Start with the same
              grind that you use with the AeroPress, and adjust from there if your coffee tastes bad.</li>
            <li>If your grind is too fine, the total brew time will be more than four minutes, and it will taste
              "overextracted." This means it will be bitter and unpleasant. YUCK!</li>
            <li>If your grind is too coarse, it will take less than three minutes and thirty seconds to brew, and the
              coffee will taste "underextracted." This means that it is kind of sour and watery. GROSS!</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Rinse the filter.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>After putting a filter in the brewer, use some hot brew water to rinse the papery taste out of it. </li>
            <li>Use enough water to warm up the brewer and the vessel that you are brewing into.</li>
            <li>Don't forget to discard the water from the brew vessel before you make your coffee!</li>
            <li>If you have a scale now is the time to put your brew vessel/brewer onto it. If you don't have a scale,
              then just wing it and use your best judgement.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Bloom</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Put your ground coffee into the brewer and start your timer. The entire bloom should take about 45
              seconds.</li>
            <li>Add two times as much hot brew water as coffee at this time. I usually brew with thirty grams of coffee,
              so I use sixty grams of water to bloom.</li>
            <li>Pick up the brewer and brew vessel and give the coffee a good ole' American swirl. Don't spill it! You
              want all the coffee to get soaked as quckly as possible.
            <li>If you want, you could use a spoon to stir it up, instead of swirling.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Add the brew water.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Carefully add the remaining brew water to the brewer. Try to fill up the cone and keep topping it up
              until you use all of your water. The more water in the brewer, the more stable the temperature is, which
              results in better coffee.</li>
            <li>Don't pour a lot of water directly onto the filter - try to pour directly onto the coffee. Use a spoon
              to carefully stir it so that no coffee remains stuck to the filter above the level of the slurry.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Drawdown</li>
          <ul>
            <li>What you're gonna wanna do now is just watch the coffee drip into the drinking or serving vessel.</li>
            <li>If the grind is right and you didn't really mess up anywhere else, it should take between 3:30 and 4:00
              minutes for all of the water to drain from the brewer.</li>
            <li>You should have a nice flat bed of grounds remaining after the drawdown, with no big bumps or craters.
              And the ground bed should definitely not be mounded up in the middle. If it is, just pour all this coffee
              down the sink and try again.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Let cool and enjoy!</li>
          <ul>
            <li>I'm just kidding! Even if you messed up along the way, the coffee is probably still pretty good. Please
              don't waste it!</li>
            <li>Let it cool a bit before you drink the yummy coffee. If it is too hot, your tongue will go into shock
              when you sip it
              and your taste buds, expecially those dedicated to detecting delicious coffee flavors, called
              "caffeinoceptors," will not work properly.</li>
            <li>Hmm. I'm surprised you didn't know that!</li>
          </ul>
        </ol>
