        <ol>
          <li>Heat up the water.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Carefully select the water that you want to make into coffee. Soft water is preferable to hard water, so
              use a Brita
              or similar filter if you need it. If your tap water has a chlorinated smell, use bottled water instead.
            </li>
            <li>Heat the water up to 208&deg;F. The extra heat extracts more flavor from the coffee. After brewing, let
              this beverage cool down for a few minutes before drinking it.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Grind the beans.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Your coffee should be ground "medium," or maybe a little finer. Start with the same
              grind that you use with the AeroPress, and adjust from there if your coffee tastes bad.</li>
            <li>If your grind is too fine, the total brew time will be more than four minutes, and it will taste
              "overextracted." This means it will be bitter and unpleasant. YUCK!</li>
            <li>If your grind is too coarse, it will take less than three minutes and thirty seconds to brew, and the
              coffee will taste "underextracted." This means that it is kind of sour and watery. GROSS!</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Rinse the filter.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>After putting a filter in the brewer, use some hot brew water to rinse the papery taste out of it. </li>
            <li>Use enough water to warm up the brewer and the vessel that you are brewing into.</li>
            <li>Don't forget to discard the water from the brew vessel before you make your coffee!</li>
            <li>If you have a scale now is the time to put your brew vessel/brewer onto it. If you don't have a scale, then just wing it and use your best judgement.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Bloom</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Put your ground coffee into the brewer and start your timer. The entire bloom should take about 45 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add two times as much hot brew water as coffee at this time. I usually brew with thirty grams of coffee, so I use sixty grams of water to bloom.</li>
            <li>Pick up the </li>
          </ul>
